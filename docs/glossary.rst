   Pyramid
      A `web framework <https://trypyramid.com>`_.

   tween
     A bit of code that sits between the Pyramid router's main request
     handling function and the upstream WSGI component that uses Pyramid as
     its 'app'.  The word "tween" is a contraction of "between".  A tween may
     be used by Pyramid framework extensions, to provide, for example,
     Pyramid-specific view timing support, bookkeeping code that examines
     exceptions before they are returned to the upstream WSGI application, or
     a variety of other features.  Tweens behave a bit like WSGI 'middleware'
     but they have the benefit of running in a context in which they have
     access to the Pyramid application registry as well as the Pyramid
     rendering machinery.  See the main Pyramid documentation for more
     information about tweens.

   Exception view
      An exception view is a :Pyramid view callable which may be invoked when
      an exception is raised during request processing.

   Logger
      A Python "standard library" ``logging`` module logger.  See
      http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html for more information about
      Python standard library logging.
